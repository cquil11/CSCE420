Please note the remark on the Sammy's Sport Shop question (resolution refutation part). I realized halfway through the problem
that my initial KB was unnecessarily complex, so I made a new, simpler version for the res. refutation part of the problem.

However, I still kept my original KB and its conversion to CNF. Hope that is okay!

Thanks.
